## Why is WiFi dangerous?

### CS 590J Final Capstone Project by Jimmy Hwang

#### Abstract
Everyone using the internet knows that one should never connect to any unverified wireless network and download suspicious files online. Yet, the severity of such dangerous acts is often not discussed or underestimated among users. This project simulates a dynamic-link library (DLL) infection via server message block (SMB) delivery using a reverse TCP attack. The infected file with a malicious payload that exploits and exfils data is forwarded to the victim connected to the same WiFi network using Metasploit. We also discuss potential methods of obfuscating the data exfiltration, such as steganography. Additionally, we conduct possible irreversible damage to the victim's system by using it as a chance to gain command and control over it.
