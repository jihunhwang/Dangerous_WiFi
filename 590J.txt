Method of access: Make a locally hosted website that either through a download button or automatically downloads exploit file

Exploit: Anything that works from Metasploit (I suggest using Windows xp or anything old)

Implant - Python script that starts at boot which includes C2 and exfil

C2 - command to delete everything, command to send back a certain file / file type, transmit data on command

Exfil - upload requested data to google drive

Implant obfuscation - Use pyarmor (or some other library that works) to try to hide python script and delete exploit binary file after it's not needed

C2 obfuscation - encrypt (doesn't count as obfuscation) and encode commands in images / videos using stenography. Put encoded messages in "commands" folder on Google drive which the implant will pull from every so often

Exfil obfuscation - same as C2 obfuscation but uploaded encoded data to "exfil" folder in Google drive
